## Part 1 - Do your own research and answer the following: ##

**1. Make a list of pros and cons of using open-source software:**
   
   *Pros:*
   
   - Open-source software is free of charge
   - Open-source software is often highly customizable in that the user has the ability to make changes to meet their specific own needs
   - Open-source software enables the user to modify it and re-sell it if permitted by the original license agreement
   - Open-source software can be shared and redistributed without permission
   - There is a high level of transparency in the process of the software’s creation and of its maintenance
   - Open-source software often has an active developer community which continues to create new features and ensure existing features remain   functional and offers support for the user community.

   *Cons:*
   
   - Open-source software may suffer from a lack of formalized, well-documented, or consistent support, for maintenance and upgrades that commercial software generally offers
   - Open-source software may lack compatibility when used with other software systems.
The user may need to license additional code, widgets or other patches to make them work with other software packages
- Open-source software may often lack the security offered by proprietary software.
- Open-source software is not guaranteed to have a large, available, or skilled developer community to offer support.
- Open-source software may have a high learning curve and require a significant amount of maintenance to keep it operational.
- Open-source software may not offer all the same functionality as it may not have all the functionality

**2. Why might Open-source software be popular for cloud computing?:**
   
*As cloud computing enables access and use to storage resources via internet; it has the ability to serve multiple needs of multiple customers simultaneous, can be scaled up or down with relative ease and resources can be accessed quickly and in an on-demand basis and enables a sizable amount of user control. This aligns well with the goals, function, philosophy and collaborative nature of communities of developers and users creating open source software as access to the cloud can both facilitate and expand to their needs and provide a platform and resource for them to work together.*

**3.	Opinion: What is a strength of Open-source software that you find surprising or counterintuitive? Why?**
   
*One of the things I find both useful and counterintuitive is that open-source software often has multiple versions of itself available simultaneously. While it is a strength, and good to maintain a copy of the ‘stable’ and reliable version (usually a few versions back) to ensure its continued function, the need to always make tweaks and upgrades to ensure you’ve got the most current functionality can be a challenge, especially when the most current version might be a little ‘buggy’. Having to maintain both a new and archival version can be a bit of work to manage.*

**4.	What is the difference between Free software and Open-source software?**
   
*From the reading I did, the emphasis on the word ‘free’ and the adherence to the concept of ‘freedom’ applying to the software seem to be running themes in many discussions; my understanding is that "all free software is open-source software, but not all open-source software is free software". Free software generally has no cover of licensing of any kind, while open-source software may still be covered by some time (even if highly permissive) of software license or other restriction.*
